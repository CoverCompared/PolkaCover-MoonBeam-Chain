![Tests](https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

Run an Ethereum compatible ~~parachain~~ (and blockchain for now, until parachains are more stable)
based on Substrate.

_See [moonbeam.network](https://moonbeam.network) for the moonbeam blockchain description._  
_See [www.substrate.io](https://www.substrate.io/) for substrate information._

## Install (linux)

### Get the code

Get the tutorial specific tag of the PureStake/Moonbeam repo:

```bash
git clone -b tutorial-v2 https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam
cd moonbeam
```

### Setting up enviroment

Install Substrate pre-requisites (including Rust):

```bash
curl https://getsubstrate.io -sSf | bash -s -- --fast
```

Run the initialization script, which checks the correct rust nightly version and adds the WASM to
that specific version:

```bash
./scripts/init.sh
```

## Build Standalone

Build the corresponding binary file:

```bash
cd node/standalone
cargo build --release
```

## Build Parachain

Build the corresponding binary file:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The first build takes a long time, as it compiles all the necessary libraries.

### Troubleshooting

If a _cargo not found_ error appears in the terminal, manually add Rust to your system path (or
restart your system):

```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## Run

### Standalone Node in dev mode

```bash
./node/standalone/target/release/moonbase-standalone --dev
```

## Docker image

### Standlone node

You can run a standalone Moonbeam node with Docker directly:

```bash
docker run --rm --name moonbeam_standalone --network host purestake/moonbase:tutorial-v2.2 /moonbase/moonbase-standalone --dev
```

## Chain IDs

The ethereum specification described a numeric Chain Id. The Moonbeam mainnet Chain Id will be 1284
because it takes 1284 milliseconds for a moonbeam to reach Earth.

Moonbeam nodes support multiple public chains and testnets, with the following Chain Ids.

| Network Description                 | Chain ID    |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Local parachain testnet             | 1280        |
| Local standalone testnet            | 1281        |
| Reserved for other testnets         | 1282 - 1283 |
| Moonbeam (Polkadot)                 | 1284        |
| Moonriver (Kusama)                  | 1285        |
| Moonrock (Rococo)                   | 1286        |
| Public parachain testnet (alphanet) | 1287        |
| Reserved for other public networks  | 1288 - 1289 |

## Runtime Architecture

The Moonbeam Runtime is built using FRAME and consists of several core pallets, as well as a few
pallets that are only present conditionally. The core pallets are:

- _Balances_: Tracks GLMR token balances
- _Sudo_: Allows a privledged acocunt to make arbitrary runtime changes - will be removed before
  launch
- _Timestamp_: On-Chain notion of time
- _EVM_: Encapsulates execution logic for an Ethereum Virtual Machine
- _Ethereum_: Ethereum-style data encoding and access for the EVM.
- _Ethereum Chain Id_: A place to store the chain id for each Moonbeam network
- _Transaction Payment_: Transaction payment (fee) management
- _Randomness Collective Flip_: A (mock) onchain randomness beacon. Will be replaced by parachain
  randomness by mainnet.

### Parachain

In addition to the core pallets above, the parachain node also features

- _ParachainUpgrade_: A helper to perform runtime upgrades on parachains
- _MessageBroker_: A helper to receive incoming XCPM messages
- _ParachainInfo_: A place to store parachain-relevant constants like parachain id
- _TokenDealer_: A helper for accepting incoming cross-chain asset transfers

### Standalone

In addition to the core pallets above, the standalone node also features

- _Aura_: Slot-based Authority Consensus
- _Grandpa_: GRANDPA Authority consensus (This will be removed once it becomes a parachain)

## Tests

Tests are run with the following command:

```bash
cargo test --verbose
```

This github repository is also linked to Gitlab CI

## Contribute

### Code style

Moonbeam is following the
[Substrate code style](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md)  
We provide a [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) (_compatible with VSCode using RLS_)
